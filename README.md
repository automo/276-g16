# Shoppu
**By Group 16, CMPT 276 D1**

Shoppu is a web-based, multi-device app that provides a platform for connecting customers and personal shoppers with each other.

### Try it out at:
http://shoppuapp.herokuapp.com/

*(Just a heads-up that this app uses the free tier of Amazon S3, so the image-uploading feature may break at some point, unless other arrangements are made)*

### Running the app locally
**Note:** A file with environment constants (shoppu\config\application.yml) is required to run the app locally. For more info, please contact existing developers.

1. Install ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
2. Open a terminal with the Ruby on Rails environment, change directory to 276-g16/shoppu/, and enter:
```
gem install rmagick // See comment below!
bundle install
rake db:migrate
bin\rails server
```

\* Basic form; this command will likely require additional arguments. It is highly recommended to follow a platform-specific guide for this step.
